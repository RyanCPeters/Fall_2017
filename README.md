# Fall_UWB_2017
This repository represents the collected works from my fall quarter at UWB. 

### Courses -- Ordered according to technical challange
* CSS 342: Datastructures, Algorithms, and Descreet Mathematics
  * This course introduces students to the practice of analyzing time and space complexities of various data structures. Analysis is done using inductive reasoning that is taught in the descreet mathematics portion of the course. These skills are then demonstrated in our c++ solutions to problems posed in class. See the css_342 folder for problems and my solutions.
* CSS 332: C++ Fundamentals
  * This course is meant to help students that are new to c++ (but proficient in Java) quickly get their bearings in the c languages. This class consisted of several short lab projects per week that help students get a sense for the various kinds of c++ pointers, as well as various subtle differences between c++ and Java.
* CSS 301: Technical Writing
  * This course was designed by UWB's CSS program in order to ensure that students from this program have the strong communication skills needed for good documentation and project coordination.
