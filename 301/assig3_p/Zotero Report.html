					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background: Our publication of the BitTorious portal [1] 
demonstrated the ability to create a privatized distributed data 
warehouse of sufficient magnitude for real-world bioinformatics studies 
using minimal changes to the standard BitTorrent tracker protocol. In 
this second phase, we release a new server-side specification to accept 
anonymous philantropic storage donations by the general public, wherein a
 small portion of each user's local disk may be used for archival of 
scientific data. We have implementated the server-side announcement and 
control portions of this BitTorrent extension into v3.0.0 of the 
BitTorious portal, upon which compatible clients may be built. Results: 
Automated test cases for the BitTorious Volunteer extensions have been 
added to the portal's v3.0.0 release, supporting validation of the "peer
 affinity" concept and announcement protocol introduced by this 
specification. Additionally, a separate reference implementation of 
affinity calculation has been provided in C++ for informaticians wishing
 to integrate into libtorrent-based projects. Conclusions: The 
BitTorrent "affinity" extensions as provided in the BitTorious portal 
reference implementation allow data publishers to crowdsource the 
extreme storage prerequisites for research in "big data" fields. With 
sufficient awareness and adoption of BitTorious Volunteer-based clients 
by the general public, the BitTorious portal may be able to provide 
peta-scale storage resources to the scientific community at relatively 
insignificant financial cost.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Abstract: Increasingly, organisations flexibly outsource work 
on a temporary basis to a global audience of workers. This so-called 
crowdsourcing has been applied successfully to a range of tasks, from 
translating text and annotating images, to collecting information during
 crisis situations and hiring skilled workers to build complex software.
 While traditionally these tasks have been small and could be completed 
by non-professionals, organisations are now starting to crowdsource 
larger, more complex tasks to experts in their respective fields. These 
tasks include, for example, software development and testing, web design
 and product marketing. While this emerging expert crowdsourcing offers 
flexibility and potentially lower costs, it also raises new challenges, 
as workers can be highly heterogeneous, both in their costs and in the 
quality of the work they produce. Specifically, the utility of each 
outsourced task is uncertain and can vary significantly between distinct
 workers and even between subsequent tasks assigned to the same worker. 
Furthermore, in realistic settings, workers have limits on the amount of
 work they can perform and the employer will have a fixed budget for 
paying workers. Given this uncertainty and the relevant constraints, the
 objective of the employer is to assign tasks to workers in order to 
maximise the overall utility achieved. To formalise this expert 
crowdsourcing problem, we introduce a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) 
model, the bounded MAB. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm to solve it
 efficiently, called bounded ε-first, which proceeds in two stages: 
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, it first uses εB of 
its total budget B to learn estimates of the workers' quality 
characteristics. Then, during exploitation, it uses the remaining to 
maximise the total utility based on those estimates. Using this 
technique allows us to derive an upper bound on its performance regret 
(i.e., the expected difference in utility between our algorithm and the 
optimum), which means that as the budget B increases, the regret tends 
to 0. In addition to this theoretical advance, we apply our algorithm to
 real-world data from oDesk, a prominent expert crowdsourcing site. 
Using data from real projects, including historic project budgets, 
expert costs and quality ratings, we show that our algorithm outperforms
 existing crowdsourcing methods by up to 300%, while achieving up to of a
 hypothetical optimum with full information.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In conventional systems like the web-based systems, 
device-based systems, or desktop systems, the Human Computer Interaction
 (HCI) spectrum encompasses of user interaction methods, interaction 
modes, user interface design, etc. that strive to facilitate a user to 
seamlessly and intuitively interact with the system to accomplish his 
system goals. This spectrum usually considers aspects pertaining to 
bringing the user to initiate interaction with the system and retaining 
the user's interest to keep interacting with the system as an outcome of
 the usability/user experience that a user obtains while interacting 
with the system. In the context of crowdsourcing, these aspects have 
individual significance and not completely user experience based. Hence,
 it is essential to widen the spectrum of HCI for crowdsourcing to 
embrace these additional aspects explicitly and provide for a 
comprehensive HCI paradigm for crowdsourcing In this paper, the 
conceptualization and definition of HCI paradigm for crowdsourcing has 
been described. The application of every aspect of the proposed paradigm
 is illustrated with respect to crowdsourcing of a typical form 
digitization task. The defined aspects could also serve as HCI 
evaluation parameters for business process task crowdsourcing</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In March 2012, Virginia Commonwealth University's VP for 
Finance and Administration created a team of innovators called team 
IMPACT. The task for team IMPACT was to create a viable methodology for 
vetting innovative ideas and to brainstorm ideas to push through this 
methodology. One of the ideas that came out of this project was to 
implement a system by which the team could gather the ideas of the 
entire university community. The team began the task of procuring and 
implementing a crowd sourcing solution. In February of 2013, team IMPACT
 began piloting a program called VCU Ideas, powered by IdeaScale. 
Through this product, team IMPACT can capture the ideas of the 
university as well as allow the university community to vote on the 
ideas. Crowd sourcing enables team IMPACT to keep their fingers on the 
pulse of the university.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The principles of open collaboration for innovation and 
production — once distinctive to open source software — are now found in
 many other ventures. Some of these ventures are internet-based: 
Wikipedia, online forums and communities; others are off-line, in 
medicine, science, and everyday life. Such ventures have been affecting 
traditional firms, and may represent a new organizational form. Despite 
the impact, questions remain about the operating principles and 
performance of such ventures. Here we define open collaboration (OC), 
the underlying set of principles, and propose that it is a robust engine
 for innovation and production. First, we review multiple OC ventures 
and identify four defining principles. In all instances, participants 
create goods and services of economic value, they exchange and reuse 
each other’s work, they labor purposefully with just loose coordination,
 and they permit anyone to contribute and consume. These principles 
distinguish OC from other organizational forms, such as firms or 
cooperatives. Next, we turn to performance. To understand the 
performance of OC, we develop a computational model, combining 
innovation theory with recent evidence on human cooperation. We identify
 and systematically vary three elements that affect performance: the 
cooperativeness of participants, the diversity of their needs, and the 
degree to which the goods are rival (subtractable). Through 
computational experiments, we find that OC performs well even in 
seemingly harsh environments: when cooperators are a minority, free 
riders are present, diversity is lacking, or goods are rival. Given the 
results, we suggest that OC is likely to continue expanding and provide 
advice for research, practice, and policy.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Crowdsourced testing is gaining a lot of attention these days.
 Crowdsourced testing utilizes testers which subscribe to an external or
 internal crowdsourcing platform. Usually these testers are distributed 
across geographies. Thus, such testing can be treated as a form of 
distributed testing. Crowdsourced testing, quite often, is used to 
perform exploratory testing in which testers test the features as per 
their wish. Such testing results in redundant testing efforts due to the
 lack of awareness of other testers' activities; thus does not yield the
 full benefits of crowdsourced testing in terms of speed and coverage. 
Moreover, as each tester possesses a testing style, the present model of
 crowdsourced testing does not fully utilize tester's strength or style.
 In this paper, we study various redundancies involved in a distributed 
testing. We also study testers' behavior to understand various testing 
styles. The study finds that there exists a lot of redundancies in 
testing efforts. The study also observes that testers indeed have 
different testing styles which should be understood more deeply for 
engaging them better. Our study shows that there is need for tools and 
strategies for allocating testing tasks that leverages testers' testing 
style and creates more awareness among the testers.</td>
